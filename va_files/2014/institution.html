      <h1>Introduction to Principles of Excellence</h1>
      <p>On April 27, 2012, the President signed Executive Order 13607: Establishing Principles of Excellence for Educational Institutions Serving Servicemembers, Veterans, Spouses, and Other Family Members. The Order and subsequent Public Law 112-249 legislated to make the Order permanent, directs VA, along with the Departments of Defense and Education in consultation with Department of Justice and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to develop and implement seven tenets to strengthen oversight, enforcement, and accountability within Veteran and military educational benefit programs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page-content  padt70">
      <div class=" col-md-12 ">
        <p class="padb20 wow fadeIn">These principles apply to educational institutions receiving funding from Federal military and Veterans educational benefit programs, including benefit programs provided by the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The principles will ensure that these educational institutions provide meaningful information to Servicemembers, Veterans, spouses, and other family members about the financial cost and quality of educational institutions to assist prospective students in making choices about how to use their Federal educational benefits; prevent abusive and deceptive recruiting practices that target the recipients of Federal military and Veterans educational benefits; and ensure that educational institutions provide high quality academic and student support services to active-duty Servicemembers, Reservists, Veterans, and military families.</p>

        <p class="wow fadeIn">Educational institutions participating in the Principles of Excellence program agree to the following guidelines:</p>

        <ul class="wow fadeIn">
          <li>Provide students with a personalized form covering the total cost of an education program.</li>
          <li>Provide educational plans for all military and Veteran education beneficiaries.</li>
          <li>End fraudulent and aggressive recruiting techniques and misrepresentations.</li>
          <li>Accommodate Servicemembers and Reservists absent due to service requirements.</li>
          <li>Designate a point of contact to provide academic and financial advice.</li>
          <li>Ensure accreditation of all new programs prior to enrolling students.</li>
          <li>Align institutional refund policies with those under Title IV, which governs the administration of federal student financial aid programs.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="wow fadeIn">Education institutions with questions about how to comply with the list above can check out the Department of Educations frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the Executive Order here: <a href="http://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/GEN1210.html">http://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/GEN1210.html</a></p>
